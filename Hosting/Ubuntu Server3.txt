#Deploy NodeJs Apps in Production on Linux VPS

apt install nodejs

***if npm is not found then run***
apt install npm

apt-get install build-essential (in order for some npm packages to work such as those that require compiling code from source)

cd /home/

mkdir nodeapp (create a directory for your applications)

cd nodeapp/

touch index.js

vim index.js

***in your index.js file set your servers IP address (00.00.00.00) as your host name***

ufw allow PORT (the port added in your index.js file)

node index.js (runs the application)

curl http://host_name:PORT (to test the application if it works)

***try not to use this command***
node index.js & (runs the application in the background but is highly discouraged and imprudent to use)

npm install -g pm2 (PM2 provides an easy way to manage and daemonize applications (run them in the background as a service))

***The -g option tells npm to install the module globally, so that itâ€™s available system-wide***

pm2 start index.js (run your application, index.js, in the background)
OR
pm2 start index.js --name "name_of_app" (add a name to the application index.js, and run in the background)

pm2 startup systemd (generates and configures a startup script to launch PM2 and its managed processes on server boots)

pm2 stop index.js/id (stop an application)

pm2 restart index.js/id (restart an application)

pm2 delete index.js (delete an application)

pm2 list/ls (list of applications like index.js currently managed by PM2)

pm2 info index.js (more information about a specific application can be found)

pm2 monit (displays the application status, CPU, and memory usage with the PM2 process monitor)
